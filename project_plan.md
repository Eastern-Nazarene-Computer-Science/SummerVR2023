this is an outline the features we intend to implement and the goals we have set for each level of the game.

2. Features to Implement
2.1 Grabbing Object: One of the core mechanics we plan to incorporate into the game is the ability
for players to interact with objects within the virtual environment. By implementing a grabbing object feature, 
players will be able to pick up and manipulate various items required to progress through the levels.

2.2 Teleporting and Walking: To provide players with enhanced freedom of movement and navigation within
the VR game, we will implement both teleportation and walking features. Players will have the option to teleport
to specific locations or physically walk within the game environment, based on their preference.

2.3 Moving Objects: In addition to grabbing objects, we intend to include a feature that allows players 
to move objects within the game. This feature will enable players to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles 
by manipulating the virtual environment.
(to be modified)

3. Level Descriptions and Goals (more levels will be added)
3.1 Level 1: Outside Exploration
The first level will be set in an outdoor environment. Players will embark on a quest to find a flashlight object,
which they will need to navigate
the surroundings effectively. Using the flashlight, players will search for a door that leads to the second level. 
The primary goal of this level is to introduce players to the basic mechanics of movement, object interaction, and navigation.

3.2 Level 2: Statue Puzzle Room
Upon entering the second level, players will find themselves in a room filled with statues. The objective will be to position 
each statue correctly, unlocking the door to the next level. This level will challenge players' problem-solving skills and their 
ability to manipulate objects within the game environment.

3.3 Level 3: Underground Tunnel and Bat Fight
The third level will take players on an underground adventure through a tunnel infested with bats. Players will engage in combat,
battling the swarm of bats to progress further into the game. This level will focus on combat mechanics.
